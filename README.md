# Wallet Budgter
This app demonstrates a fundamental budgeting app example running [React Native for windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), vnext.

## Notice

This repo contains **only the javascript code** and the individual **react-native-table-component** external module. It will not run as-is and is intended to be downloaded and copied into an already setup vnext project, [instructions here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/vnext/docs/GettingStarted.md).
